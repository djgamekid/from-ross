## Ponderosa
I miss this restaurant honestly. A buffet with the world's best **chicken wings** and **steak**. They also made butter rolls better than *Texas Roadhouse*. As a kid I definitely gained a few pounds from eating here with my family every other week. There aren't any left and what a shame cause Dr. Hoot would like this place.

## The Great Bruce Lee
> “Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”

>"A teacher is never a giver of truth - he is a guide, a pointer to the truth that each student must find for himself."
