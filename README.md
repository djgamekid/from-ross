## Ponderosa
I miss this restaurant honestly. A buffet with the world's best **chicken wings** and **steak**. They also made butter rolls better than *Texas Roadhouse*. As a kid I definitely gained a few pounds from eating here with my family every other week. There aren't any left and what a shame cause Dr. Hoot would like this place.
