My favorite song is a 90s rap song called *Lougin'* by LL Cool J. It was on his 6th studio album *Mr. Smith* in 1995. The song itself is a boastful flirtatious plea to a woman he likes. She has a boyfriend, but he personally doesn't think he's treating her right only giving her money and clothes. The groove has a more famous remix which featured the R&B group *Total*.
